# Coding--Quiz

## Description

- The aim of this project is to create a quiz that is governed by a timer. Once start is pressed the timer will begin and a new question will show. The user then has to select an answer and move on to the next question.
- If the answer is right then they will keep answering until either the timer runs out or all the questions are answered. If the timer is wrong they will move on to the next question but there will be a time penalty.
- Once the game is finished the user's score will be logged in the highscores section using local storage on the browser. The score will be the amount of time that was left.

## Future features

- This project can be added to with different questions, or even being able to select questions from a group of categories. The style and design of the page can also be changed to make it more aesthetic.
